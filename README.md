# Java-Spring-MySQL-Docker

This repo will showcase developing a Java Spring Tomcat webapp using MySQL, where the web server and database are run in separate Docker containers instead of on the host machine.

## Database

Navigate to the `database` directory and follow the instructions in the `README.md` file to build the MySQL image and run it by hand.

Follow these steps to build and run it using the `docker-compose` command.
